Kino Wheels Project with extra Axis

This is a derrivative of the original Keno Wheels project found here : https://www.kinowheels.com This adds a third axis to have Pan / Tilt / Roll or whatever you want on your other axis is up to you.

I also added a Blinky light function, so that you can see if the encoder data is being read without a serial monitor.
